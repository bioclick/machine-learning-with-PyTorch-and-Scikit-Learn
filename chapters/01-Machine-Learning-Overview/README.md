# Chapter 1: Machine Learning Overview

## What is Machine Learning

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating systems that can learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following a fixed set of rules, these systems analyze patterns in data, learn from those patterns, and use what they learn to make predictions or decisions. For instance, a machine learning model can identify spam emails by studying past examples or recommend movies by learning your viewing preferences. Essentially, it's like teaching computers to recognize patterns and solve problems on their own.
