# Chapter 17: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

## What are GANs

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks contesting with each other in a zero-sum game framework.

## Architecture 
- **Generator:** The generator model takes in random noise as input and generates data (e.g., images, videos, audio, etc.). The goal of the generator is to produce data that is indistinguishable from genuine data to the discriminator.
- **Discriminator:** The discriminator model, on the other hand, examines samples to determine whether they are real (from the dataset) or fake (generated by the generator). Its job is to accurately classify the input data as real or fake.

These two models are trained simultaneously in a game-theoretic scenario where the generator tries to maximize the probability of the discriminator making a mistake

## Dataset 
We have used the famous MNIST dataset which is available [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Here is a snippet of this dataset after loading it:
