## Introduction
Here we want to start a journey and learn everything from sctrach. Therefore, no need to worry about not having a robust backgroung in this field of study.

We are using [this repo](https://github.com/rasbt/machine-learning-book) as our reference. For further information, you can read the book they have provided. Below, you find a list of contents we are about to cover. Commence the exploration to become hero from zero.
